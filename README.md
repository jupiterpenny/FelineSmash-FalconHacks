# Feline Smash, ## like face smash but with cats.
Created in 4 hours at Falcon Hacks, a mini hackathon at Daytona State College ATC campus.

Made by Amanda K, Daniel Jackson, and Brendan Tackney.
We used NodeJS to create a  game where mulitple players, in real time, can discover which cat they think is the cutest.
